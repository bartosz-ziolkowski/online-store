# ButikDK - online store with sneakers

## Overview
ButikDK is an e-commerce platform where you can buy shoes. It is a fully functional online store where, after registering, users can add selected products to their cart and then pay for them with a fictional payment card. I wanted to create this type of project because online stores are a standard, making it a valuable skill to have.

With this project, I aimed to further refine my skills in Java Spring Boot and Angular, but I wanted to take it a step further. I utilized Redis as a caching store for the shopping cart. Additionally, I integrated user authentication using a third-party application, specifically the popular Keycloak. Moreover, I implemented a payment gateway to enhance the user experience, using Stripe for this purpose.
